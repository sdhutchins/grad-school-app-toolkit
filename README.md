# Graduate School Application Toolkit

Welcome to the Graduate School Application Toolkit! This repository contains a collection of materials, templates, and
examples designed to help you craft strong, effective documents for graduate school applications in STEM
(*particularly biomedical sciences*). This resource aims to guide you through the
process with practical advice and real-world examples.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer on Integrity ‚ö†Ô∏è

This toolkit is designed to help guide you through the graduate school application process by providing templates,
examples, and resources to craft your documents. **It is essential to uphold academic integrity and ethical standards when
using these materials.** The provided templates and examples are for reference and inspiration only. Your personal
statements, CVs, and other application documents should reflect your unique experiences, goals, and qualifications.

**Plagiarism is strictly prohibited.** Copying content directly from these examples, or any other source, without
proper attribution or personal modification is a violation of academic integrity and can severely impact your
application. Graduate schools expect originality and honesty in all submitted materials.

By using this toolkit, you agree to:

- Use the provided resources solely as guidance.
- Ensure all content in your application materials is your own work.
- Avoid copying or reusing substantial portions of text from the examples without significant modification to reflect
 your own experiences and goals.

Maintaining integrity throughout the application process not only upholds your reputation but also ensures that you
represent yourself accurately to potential graduate programs. Good luck, and remember,
you are showcasing your *own* potential!

## üéì Why Use This Toolkit?

When I was applying to graduate school, I found it challenging to write compelling personal statements and CVs that
appropiately showcased my experiences and goals. I created this toolkit to help others navigate the application process.
I feel fortunate that my undergraduate premed program (XU!!) provided me with a lot of resources and guidance that gave me a
leg up on applying, but I know that not everyone has access to such resources.

I hope that this toolkit can help people who don't have access to the same resources I did. That should not be a barrier to
applying to graduate school.
