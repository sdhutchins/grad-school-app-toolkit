# Graduate School Application Toolkit

Welcome to the Graduate School Application Toolkit! This repository contains a collection of materials, templates, and
examples designed to help you craft strong, effective documents for graduate school applications in STEM
(*particularly biomedical sciences*). This resource aims to guide you through the
process with practical advice and real-world examples.

## üéì Why Use This Toolkit?

When I was applying to graduate school, I found it challenging to write compelling personal statements and CVs that
appropiately showcased my experiences and goals. I created this toolkit to help others navigate the application process.
I feel fortunate that my undergraduate premed program (XU!!) provided me with a lot of resources and guidance that gave me a
leg up on applying, but I know that not everyone has access to such resources.

I hope that this toolkit can help people who don't have access to the same resources I did. That should not be a barrier to
applying to graduate school.
