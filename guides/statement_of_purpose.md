Mention specific courses, research projects, internships, or lab work that helped you develop skills in this area. What technical skills (e.g., laboratory techniques, programming, data analysis) or methodologies did you learn, and how did they shape your interest in this field? Reflect on any professors, classes, or subjects that were particularly impactful.

Example questions to consider:

## Key Research Projects or Independent Work

**Key Research Projects or Independent Work:**  
Describe a major research project, thesis, or independent study that you undertook. What was the main focus of the project, and what were your specific contributions? Discuss the methods, tools, or techniques you applied and how they were relevant to the field. How did this project refine your academic interests or change your understanding of the field? Did it introduce you to new areas or inspire you to pursue a particular research topic?

Example questions to consider:
